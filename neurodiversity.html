                        Neurodiversity is when a persons brain works differently than others.

                        <br><br> Neurodiversity, sometimes called special needs, is when someones mind works in special ways. 

                        <br><br> This may include finding writing or reading harder than other classmates, being unable to 'read the room' --in extreme ways, or even, not being able to recognize faces (also in an extreme extent).

                        <br><br> Neurodiversity is not curable, hence it is not like depression or anxiety disorders. They are uncontrollable in most cases, thus everyone should treat people with special needs like normal people.

                        <br><br> Our aim in this article-like website is to bring you understanding to special people around you and how to treat them like a good person.
